## Assessment 2: Practice question and search strategy

### Description

The purpose of this assignment is to develop a practice question that may be answered through a search of the literature, and develop and execute a systematic search strategy to address the question.

- Define the problem, put the question into context, and build the question, using the elements of framing a question (PICO or PIE).
- Describe your search strategy for the evidence (it is important to show what you did to conduct the search including effective, appropriate use of Boolean operators and other database search functions)
- Place the results of your search in an Appendix - this will not count toward the page limit of the assignment. Show how you expanded and/or contracted your search.

**Due week 7 (Friday October 30 by 4:00 pm EDT)**

**30% of final grade**

### Structure

_Headings to be used within the paper should include the following:_

**Background:** brief description of the situation or problem, formal statement of the search question, specifying concepts that form the basis of your search (the Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome or the Population/problem, Intervention/exposure, and Evaluation/Outcomes) and justification for the importance or relevance of the question

**Search Methodology:** description of search strategies used to conduct the electronic search (search terms, combinations of terms, databases used (minimum of 2), the number and types of studies you discovered etc.)

**Results:** evaluation of the effectiveness of the search strategy (final number and types of studies that you included, relevance of studies to question).

- Maximum 4 pages, double-spaced on standard-sized paper (8.5" x 11") with 1" margins on all sides.
