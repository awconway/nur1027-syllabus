## Course description

A major responsibility for masters-prepared advanced practiced nurses in leadership roles (formal or informal) is promoting evidence-informed practice and policy decisions within nursing. In order to be successful in this endeavour, nurses must be knowledgeable consumers of nursing and related (e.g. health services and social sciences) research. This course and the subsequent course NUR1127 will further develop your knowledge, skill, and judgment related to research competencies for advanced practice nurses as outlined in the <a target="_parent" href="https://cna-aiic.ca/en/nursing-practice/the-practice-of-nursing/advanced-nursing-practice">Canadian Nurses’ Association document “Advanced Practice Nursing: A Pan-Canadian Framework (2019)”</a>.

The focus of NUR1027 is on critical examination and reflection on research and evidence-informed practice, with an emphasis on integration of theory and research to guide practice. You will develop an understanding of the philosophical foundations of contemporary approaches to knowledge production in nursing and the health sciences, and essential competencies in locating, interpreting, critiquing, and using research evidence in practice. Critical analysis of both qualitative and quantitative approaches and their underlying theoretical frameworks will enable you to understand and appropriately integrate research into practice.



## Course objectives

*The overall objectives of the course are to enable students to:*

- Appreciate the integral role of research evidence in informing nursing practice.
- Understand the development of major approaches to knowledge production in the health sciences (philosophy of science.)
- Situate qualitative and quantitative modes of inquiry within their respective ontological and epistemological foundations.
- Understand the relationship between the philosophical foundations of different research designs and approaches, and apply criteria for assessing rigour (truth value) of these designs and approaches.
- Cultivate a sensitivity to, and appreciation of, the complexity and diversity of nursing research approaches relevant to leadership and health services.

*Specifically, students will develop the ability to:*

- Critically appraise and use frameworks and strategies to support evidence-informed practice and knowledge translation.
- Formulate clear, specific questions about health care practice that can be addressed with research evidence.
- Plan and execute a systematic search to locate evidence to answer practice questions.
- Critically appraise and interpret descriptive research studies that employ different approaches.


## Course time commitment

Most students will need a **minimum 8-10 hours/week** to complete the readings and learnings activities and participate in the discussion group.  **Additional time** will be required to complete assignments.


## Course communication

Please ensure that you have an active your.name@utoronto.ca or your.name@mail.utoronto.ca e-mail address as this is the only one to which faculty will respond.  If your contact information changes, please notify the MN Graduate and Curriculum Assistant (academic.nursing@utoronto.ca) and update ACORN immediately.

Quercus will be used to post the course syllabus, recorded lectures, weekly readings and other learning activities, and important announcements.  Click <a target="_blank" href="https://q.utoronto.ca/courses/46670">here</a> for Quercus information and resources.

Please also use our course Quercus site Discussion section to ask questions about class content and assignments.  Many of you will have similar questions and we can ensure consistent responses to your concerns by using Quercus.  We (the Teaching Assistant or I) will read and respond to Quercus postings and messages and our Discussions (via Quercus) on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays by 5 pm.  E-mail communication with either the Professor or the TA should be used only for purposes other than asking questions about course content (e.g., for scheduling a one-to-one appointment) or for communication of a personal nature.

Forwarding your utoronto.ca email to a different type of email account is not advisable. In some cases, messages from utoronto.ca addresses sent to other accounts are filtered as junk mail, which means that emails from your course instructor may end up in your spam or junk mail folder.


## Course participation

The Quercus Discussion Board is our virtual classroom. This is where we will engage in discussion and clarification of the course material, and practise applying course concepts. In order to make the most of this opportunity, we need to allow time for these asynchronous discussions to unfold over the week. Thus it is important that you go join the discussions several times over the week, rather than posting only at the end of the week.
To facilitate discussion there will be a number of questions posed each week. It is important that all students participate in these discussions. I ask that you please keep your postings succinct **(maximum 200 words (text) or 2 minutes audio/video)** so that others have an opportunity to respond as well. Postings must be presented in your own words and reflect a critical analysis and interpretation of course material, exercises, and other learning activities.  You are encouraged to share insights into the application and use of course concepts in practice. Please include relevant references in your posts (not included in the word count).
Students are expected to read assigned material for each week and respond to each other’s postings and questions.  The minimum expectation is that you submit one posting of your own and provide a short but substantive response to at least one other student’s post each week.


*Relevance and Content*

The student:

-	Comments and questions and thoughtfully addresses the topic and question.
-	Demonstrates s/he has read the discussion and has taken the discussion into consideration before posting.
-	Contributes new ideas (e.g., new perspectives, examples) in integrating relevant readings.
-	Makes connections between ideas (e.g., connects concepts, explains similarities).
-	Applies and rephrases ideas from previous classes accurately and appropriately.
-	Asks questions that promote in-depth discussion.

*Tone and Clarity*

-	Tone is respectful, friendly and professional.
-	Proofreads comments for clarity before posting.

- Always be courteous to other students
- Before introducing a new topic area, search to see if a similar discussion point already exists
- Stay on-topic
- Avoid the use of all CAPTIAL LETTERS in posts. ALL CAPS is considered shouting
